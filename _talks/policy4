This analysis is based on micro-econometric tools that aim to estimate the causal effect of the installation of HSBB in a zone defined at a fine level (alternatively the commune and the cadastral parcel), by comparing it with other similar zones not benefiting from HSBB at that time. In particular, by comparing these two types of area before and after the arrival of THD, we can quantify the effect of this event.More info [here](https:/www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiepP_Xw-mCAxVgVKQEHVLiASYQFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipp.eu%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F12%2FImpact_Covid___Rapport_Final_DARES-1.pdf&usg=AOvVaw08xragu8JNeoys4VKtAyZ6&opi=89978449)
