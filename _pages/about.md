Welcome! 
======

<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en/researcher/nicolas-ghio.html), working under the supervision of [Pierre Cahuc](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc/). My research areas include labor economics, and especially labor supply and active labor market policies. I am affiliated with the research center of the French Ministry of Work, [DARES](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr) and with [Sécurisation des Parcours Professionels Chair]([http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/](https://www.chaire-securisation.fr)). I also benefit from the guidance and expertise of [Arne Uhlendorff](https://sites.google.com/site/arneuhlendorff/home) and [Antoine Ferey](https://sites.google.com/site/fereyantoine) as members of my thesis committee. You can also find more of my research  [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/research/). 

Prior entering the Ph.D. I worked as a research data analyst for Pr. [Jesse Rothstein](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/) (UC Berkeley). and as a junior economist at Institut des Politiques Publiques (PSE / CREST) in Paris. You can also find my resume [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/cv/).
